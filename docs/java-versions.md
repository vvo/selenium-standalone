### Ensure you have the minimum required Java version

With the release of Selenium 3+, the minimum required version of Java is 8.

If an older selenium version is needed, you can check the requirements on the [official Selenium changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/master/java/CHANGELOG).

Here is a reference sheet for the more recent Selenium version:
